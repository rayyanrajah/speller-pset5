For this problem, I implemented a program that spell-checks a file using a hash table.

This is my solution of the CS50 speller problem set, using C. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/5/speller/ This problem set required implemnetation of a program which spell-checks a file (from a list of words, i.e. the dictionaries provided by CS50).

This was produced as a part of CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science. Uploading of my solution to Github is considered to be reasonable regarding the academic honesty policy. (https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/)

This problem required the implementation of the following functions (all within dictionary.c);

- load
- hash
- size
- check
- unload
